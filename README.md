Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Neural Networks and Attention Mechanisms
Author: Arunkumar
Course / Module:AI Programmer

📘 Overview

This project implements an advanced time series forecasting pipeline combining:

Deep Learning (DL) using a Transformer-based attention model, and

Traditional statistical forecasting using a SARIMAX baseline.

The project uses a 5-year multivariate hourly dataset, includes full preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and a detailed comparison between the deep learning model and the traditional baseline.

All requirements from the assignment instructions have been implemented, including:

Multivariate dataset with ≥3 correlated features

Attention-based neural forecasting model

Baseline SARIMAX model

Model comparison using RMSE & MAE

Clean modular code with PEP-257 docstrings
